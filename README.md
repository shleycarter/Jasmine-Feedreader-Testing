## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Navigate to the directory on your machine where you'd like to store this app:

```bash

cd /home/user/my_project

```

Clone this repo to get all of the necessary dependencies:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/shleycarter/Jasmine-Feedreader-Testing.git

```

You will then need to either use a simple [Python Server](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/modules-in-python/how-to-use-simplehttpserver/) or an extension on your code editor like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to preview the app on a local host.
